-----------
The requirement for user to be able to view historic calculations was not able to be implemented within the given time.
Planned implementation would be to serialise each LoanRequest object to json and append it to a file containing all previously serialised requests.
This json file would be read on application start and each LoanRequest object deserialised so a full list of historic calculation requests can be held in memory.

If the user wanted to update one of these request records. An ID would be passed as a command line parameter as well as any fields in the request(e.g. EndDate) to update.

The updated request would be put through the calculator and results printed to console as normal.
